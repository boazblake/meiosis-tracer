# Meiosis-Tracer

**NEW: VERSION 2** - improved UI, can work with any stream, even outside of the Meiosis pattern;
no longer requires `meiosis` as a dependency.

Meiosis-Tracer is a development and debugging tool that traces, rewinds, and replays snapshots of
streams such as [flyd](https://github.com/paldepind/flyd),
[Mithril](https://mithril.js.org/stream.html),
[RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/),
[most.js](https://github.com/cujojs/most), and so on.

You can also directly enter your own snapshots and send the values onto the streams. This works
particularly well in [Meiosis](https://meiosis.js.org) applications.

You can use Meiosis-Tracer either by adding it to a page of your web application, or as a
Chrome DevTools Extension.

Please refer to the [Meiosis-Tracer Documentation](https://meiosis.js.org/tracer/index.html) for
all the details.
