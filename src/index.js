/*
1. Live change
- receive values from meiosis with update=true. This will add to the tracer's history
  and increase the slider max.
- re-render the tracer view with update=true.

2. Time-travel change
- send MEIOSIS_RENDER_MODEL with sendValuesBack=false
- we already have the values in the snapshot, so don't need anything back
- re-render the tracer view with update=false.

3. Typing in model textarea
- send MEIOSIS_RENDER_MODEL with sendValuesBack=true. The tracer needs to get
  the computed values from the other streams.
- receive values from meiosis with update=false so this will not add to the tracer's history.
- re-render the tracer view with update=false.
